In 2011, we underwent a renovation. \r\n</div><div><br></div><div><b>Interesting Facts</b></div><p><br></p><ul><li>In 1998, we were the first library in the world to use the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system, which allowed books to be processed immediately as they were returned through automated Bookdrops so that the loan records of the borrowers were updated instantly. \r\n</li><li>RFID technology was rolled out to all libraries after its successful pilot at our library and this cut down the time taken to update patron records by 30 minutes.\r\n</li><li>Our library was designed to resemble an ordinary retail shopfront for better integration in the mall.</li></ul>",

The $4.5 million library was fully computerised – a milestone in 1988, and housed a collection of 100,000 publications. We were renovated and refurbished in 2012 with a new nature-themed look. We also added a lounge area in the Adult's Section. </p><p><b>Interesting Facts\r\n</b></p><ul><li>Our library was the first public library in Singapore to have a special thematic collection on cookery and food-related literature.</li><li>In line with the lush greenery around the Geylang East Library, which is located near the Aljunied MRT station, we included potted plants and trees into our spaces after our renovation in 2012. We want to bring nature closer to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p>",

It was later closed and relocated to the Frontier Community Place, co-locating with Frontier Community Club. Reopened to the public on 10 Mar 2006, our new library is three times bigger than before and it spans an area of 4,232 square metres. With our relocation to a dedicated community building, we bring greater convenience to our users.  \r\n</div><div><br></div><div><b>Interesting Facts\r\n</b></div><div><br></div><div>We were the first in our network of public libraries to prototype the concept of integrating with a community centre.

It was the third full-time library built by the National Library under its plan to decentralise home reading services and to bring the library nearer to the people. In 2000, it shifted to be co-located with the Marine Parade Community Complex, where it occupied 3 1/2 stories floors.  The library closed for renovations from 9 May 2022 and will reopen in the same location in 2025. \r\n</p><p><b>Interesting Facts\r\n</b></p><ul><li>When our library was first opened in 1978, it was the first branch library to be designed with full air-conditioning and was a stand-alone two-storey building. It remains the only library in Singapore to be built on reclaimed land. </li><li>Until the closure, the library has been co-located with the Marine Parade Community Club and a theatre company, The Necessary Stage. </li><li>Social story of our library </li><li>Library Details<br></li></ul>",

The library was thus developed with the aim of reaching out to the large number of young families in the area. Our library, located at White Sands Shopping Centre, was officially opened on 6 October 2000. It underwent renovations in 2015 and was officially reopened by then Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on 28 November 2015. \r\n</p><p><b>Interesting Facts\r\n</b></p><ul><li>Pasir Ris is perhaps a contraction of Pasir Hiris (in Malay) where Pasir means \"Sand\" and Hiris means \"to shred\". Pasir Ris may also translate to 'white sand'. </li><li>Drawing inspiration from the many leisure spots in and around Pasir Ris, our library has been designed to encourage rest and relaxation while you read and learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>\r\n</p>",

We were the second public library to be opened during the rapid expansion of the public library network in the 1970s. We had a major renovation and reopened on 10 May 1999 by then Minister for Home Affairs and Member of Parliament for the Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, Mr Wong Kan Seng. Our three-storey high library building is located in the heart of Toa Payoh Central, serving the residents of Toa Payoh and Novena.  \r\n</div><div><br></div><div><b>Interesting Facts\r\n</b></div><div><br></div><div>Our Children's Section at level 1 reflects the nostalgic memories of the traditional dragon playground in Toa Payoh.

In 2017, we moved to a new location at Our Tampines Hub, an integrated community and lifestyle hub, and officially reopened on 5 August 2017.

It was Singapore’s first full-fledged regional library following the prototype regional library in Tampines.  Occupying four storeys and part of a basement over a floor space of 11,100 square meters in the Woodlands Civic Centre, it is a one-stop information centre for the northern sector of Singapore. \r\n</p><p><b>Interesting Facts\r\n</b></p><ul><li>When our library was opened in 2001, it attracted 100,000 visitors on Day 1.\r\n</li><li>The reading area in our children’s section is designed as a park, with an Enchanted Tree. The nature theme is inspired by our location – we are near to three nature reserves (Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Sungei Khatib Bongsu and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve).</li></ul><p>\r\n</p>\r\n",
