//IGNORE -- js ensure this sort of works in frontend, no need to create separate function for this logic

//start chat when send message only if chat doesnt exist yet
//else redirect to existing chat

//only create a chat when message is sent


//? but right now, no such thing as "Chat" in database --> literally just get all the messages with the UserId from database


//notifications for chat?
//show red when have unread notifs
